### Week 2 notes

#### What we did
- We decided to focus on the noise generation.
- Our plan is to generalize the approach do color images more efficiently, and do different transitions.
- By converting the image to a different color space, we can greatly reduce the number of channels.


#### Feedback
- There should be no chapters in a scientific paper.
- We can have an **Appendix**, an **Abstract** instead of a Preface, and an **Introduction**. The main body should contain our approach and findings. 
- The conclusion can be more subjective, while the main body should contain mainly factual information.
- The **Implementation** should be expanded upon, ~5 pages.

#### Questions
- We can implement a fractional SWAP gate using a modified square root SWAP gate, where the term of the inner matrix in the Sqrt SWAP have a _t_ term.   

#### Summary
- Combine chapters 2 and 3.
- Restructure the document to look more like a scientific article.
- We should come to the point from the start.
- We have the green light for the idea and report :)
