## Main Questions
- What is the boundary between related work and introduction?

- When should we talk about the choices we made?
- Future work section?


## Main advice
- Can use APS template for a better format - smaller margins, etc.
- Put only what serves our narrative into the paper.
- Can use extended figures to put most of the images into an Appendix.

#### Introduction
- Have problem statement, limitations, and the goal / scope of the paper. 
- Can mention sections. 
- Most references can be in the introduction.

#### Literature review
- Section is kind of awkward; too much for a small-size paper. Some parts should be moved to the introduction, but details such as formulas should be moved to 'Method'

#### Method
- In principle looks good, but we could (should) make 'Methods' a subsection of 'Results', but this can be tweaked at the end once we have the full scope of the project.

#### Results
- It would be good to provide a short introduction for each subsection, to help guide the readers.
- We can talk about choices that we made here.

#### Discussion
- It should link every part of the paper together.
- Discussion should NOT have multiple parts; it should be treated as a summary / conclusion of the paper.

#### Conclusion and Future Research
- These 2 sections can be incorporated into the 'Discussion' section.

## Summary
- We will extend the introduction with research questions
- Remove literature review
- Introduction can be ~ 1-2 pages
- Abstract can be very short
