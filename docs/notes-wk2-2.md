### Meeting 3 notes

#### Feedback / suggestions
- Use phase information to encode color and use probability to encode intesity
- Multidimensional swap gate for swapping images can be generated very easily
- Srqtswap gate maximally entangles qubits
- Do not use Iswap
    - When you swap back, the phase information is still maximally entangled
    - If you only work with probabilities, there is no change
- Limit image sizes

#### Discussions
- Do we start working with actual measurement and shot counts instead of statevector?
    - Try swap with statevector
- Run once on quantum computer without phase information
    - Will also add noise, "can be quite fun"
    - Add a very boring image with certain patterns to visualize how noise is spreading, or visualize the effect of gates
        - If noise is not spreading uniformly, you will see in the image
        - First to visualize noise in a direct way

"fun and refreshing idea"
